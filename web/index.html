this file should be an explanation of how the app works, a sternly worded warning on the app being beta, and a link to twitter_login.php to get started.

flow:

index.html: this page
twitter_login.php: redirects to twitter to get app auth
step1.php: form to input username. (later versions: checkbox for replies/RTs)
step2.php: send data to backend, refresh to step3.php
step3.php: refresh loop until status = done
step4.php: get_list on backend, read to memory. create output of userids in form of csv, download.

this seems like more steps that are necessary, but it leaves some room for further features without having to drastically change the flow.
